# Finite state machine
This is a simple finite state machine implementation in Godot, for the game dev minor.
Used the following [finite state machine tutorial](https://www.gdquest.com/tutorial/godot/design-patterns/finite-state-machine/), with modifications.

## Build
The build is exported to the `build` folder.

## Controls
- WASD to move (or arrow keys)
- Space to jump (or up arrow)
- SHIFT to dash (only works when in Jump or Fall state)
- Hold CTRL to slide (only works when running)
